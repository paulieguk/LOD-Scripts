## Scenario - There is a requirement to ensure learners cannot complete a lab until a period of time have passed.

##  Setup:
##  Create an Automated activity with the script below in adjusting vales as required.  Ensure the activity is 
##   configured as On-Demand evaluation and blocks page navigation until passed.  If the lab is scored it would
##   be suggested this item is not scored.

## This script will use the Details API to establish the runtime of a Lab Instance.
## The scipt will only pass/be true once the number of seconds in the $LabDurationSec variable is greater
##  than the total lab runtime.  Because this uses the details API call the lab instance data has
##  to be available via that API consumer.


$result = $false
$evidence = 'test'

## Set your api key,  Be sure to remove the <>Brackets when adding the api key.
$api_key = @{'api_key' = 'API Key here'}
$baseURL = 'https://labondemand.com/api/v3'
$apiCMD = 'details?labinstanceID='
$labInstanceID = '@lab.LabInstance.Id'

## Set this variable for how long you wish the lab to held in this location before the learner can press 
##  next in the instructions. The TS and TSC varibles are used to calculate the time in minutes for easier 
##  user communication.

$labdurationsec = 300
$ts = New-TimeSpan -Seconds $labdurationsec

## Powershell setup the API Call.
$apiCall = @{
        Method = "Get"
        Uri =  "$($baseURL)/$($apiCMD)$($labinstanceID)"
        ContentType = "application/json"
        Headers = $api_key
    }

## This is the actual API Call to get the class as it is currently.
$apiResponse = Invoke-RestMethod @apiCall

if ($apiResponse.TotalRunTime -ge $labdurationsec) {
    $tsc = New-TimeSpan -Seconds $apiResponse.TotalRunTime
    $evidence = "Current lab duration is $($tsc.minutes) minutes."
    $result = $true
    }
    Else {
    $tsc = New-TimeSpan -Seconds $apiResponse.TotalRunTime
    $evidence = "Current lab runtime is $($tsc.minutes) minutes.  Once lab runtime is greater than $($ts.Minutes) minutes you can continue"
    $result = $false
    }

$evidence
$result
