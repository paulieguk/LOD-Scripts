This folder contains a list of miscellaneous scripts as working examples developed for customers.


**[001 - Only progress in instructions after a period of time](https://github.com/paulieguk/LODScripts/blob/main/Sample%20other/001%20-%20Only%20progress%20in%20instructions%20after%20a%20period%20of%20time)**

This first script the customer requirement was to need to ensure learners could not end a lab until a period of time had passed.  This was completed by evaluating 
the Lab Instance Total Run Time and then comparing to a value the customer require.  This was then added to an OnDemand Automated Activity and configured not to
allow the user to continue until the test passed and the test would only passed after the set time value.
